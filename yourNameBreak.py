#Example of while loop using a break statement
#The Break statement: to break out of a while loopâ€™s clause early
while True:
    print('Please type your name:')
    name=input()
    if name=='Alexander':
        break
print('Thanks you bro!')

#Since the condition is Tre, the loop will always keep iterating
#Condition True will always evaluates down tthe value True. This will enter on a loop
#It exit the loop whe it reach the break statement
